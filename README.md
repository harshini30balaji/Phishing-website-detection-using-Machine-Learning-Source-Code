Machine learning is a way to detect phishing websites accurately. Machine learning algorithms can find patterns in a websiteâ€™s elements that humans may not see. However, it is critical to understand the problems and limitations of employing machine learning for phishing website identification. With additional study and development, machine learning has the potential to become a vital tool for countering phishing attempts.
Detecting phishing websites is essential for several reasons. Most importantly, it helps customers avoid falling prey to phishing scams. Users can protect critical information from thieves by recognizing and blocking fake websites. Furthermore, detecting phishing websites helps businesses retain their reputation and integrity. If users link a brand with phishing attempts, they may lose trust in the brand, resulting in financial losses and reputational harm.
Several machine learning methods may be utilized to detect phishing websites efficiently. Some of the most widely used algorithms are:
Random Forest: Random Forest is a group learning system that makes predictions based on several decision trees. It is ideal for detecting phishing websites since it can handle big datasets and is not prone to overfitting.
Support vector machines (SVMs): SVM is a supervised learning technique that can be applied to classification tasks. It operates by determining which hyperplane best splits the data into multiple classes. SVM is good at detecting phishing websites because it can handle high-dimensional data and is resistant to noise.
Logistic regression: Logistic regression is a statistical model used to perform binary classification tasks. It estimates the likelihood of a specific outcome based on the input features. Logistic regression helps detect phishing websites due to its simplicity and interpretability.But we will use random forest to create machine learning model for phishing detection
